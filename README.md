# The Kitten Programming Language

**Kitten** is a minimalistic, statically typed, impure functional programming language with concatenative semantics. This is an in-progress implementation of that language.

 * Visit the [official site][1].

 * Read a [short intro][2].

 * Subscribe to the [mailing list][3].

The original implementation was compiled to C. In the interest of faster iteration on language features, the current implementation is interpreted.

# Building

To build the compiler, you need GHC â‰¥7.4. Simply run:

```
git clone git://github.com/evincarofautumn/kitten.git
cd kitten
make all
```
